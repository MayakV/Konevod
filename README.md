Small telegram bot for a friend's telegram marketplace. Discontinued as of now

All the control is done either directly through chat with bot or through group channe with the admins, all you have to do is start the bot on remote machine.
After saving prducts in folders you are supposed to manually add pictures in folders. That's because pictures are provided separately andd there is no way
of cennecting them automatically
The bot supports following commands:

  1. load_products
  
      Upon receiveing command bot will look for file named "catalog.xlsx" in root directory. This file is expected to have very specific format, it's generated by
    manufacterer on a monthly basis. It will extract product's info and photo, for each one create a folder in "products_to_add" directory, save info in json format,
    save photo and make it a logo of the folder.
  2. post_products
  
      The bot goes through all the folders in "products_to_add", reads info, loads images and posts it all in marketplace chat.  
  3. post_product <product_code>
  
      Looks for product in "products_to_add" folder, reads info, loads images and posts it all in marketplace chat.  
  
There are few improvements like:
  - better error handling
  - adding more logs
  - adding commands to get and post info from chat message
  - deconstructing code more
  
Sadly the friend's project is closed so there is no reason to work on the project anymore
